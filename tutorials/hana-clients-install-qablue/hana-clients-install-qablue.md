3. Click "Maintain Restrictions" and set the appropriate restriction levels for the new role

4. Save the role.

5. Repeat these 4 steps until all necessary roles for your application are created 


### Create Employees

Before we can assign roles to business users, we need to create employees in the system. 

To do this, as the administrator, logon to the Fiori Launchpad for the consumer tenant using the URL shared by the provider (the route for the consumer)

1. Open the Maintain Employees app

    ![Maintain Employees](MaintainEmployees.png)

2. To create employees in the app, there are 2 options.

Option 1: Create Individual Employee Record.

[OPTION BEGIN [Create Individual Employee Record]]

The first option is to create individual employees

2. Enter at least the mandatory fields in the form under both the "General Information" and "Contact Information" sections

3. Click "Create"

[OPTION END]

Option 2: Import Employee Record from Excel.

[OPTION BEGIN [Import Employee Records from Excel]]

The second option is to import employee records from Excel

### Create business users and assign business roles

Next we create a business user for the employee. 
To do this, select the radio button against the employee record created in step 2 and click "Maintain Business User".

Once the business user is created, we can assign roles to the users.

You should be navigated to the "Maintain Business User" app automatically after creation of the business user. Here, click "Add" under the "Assigned Business Roles" section or alternately, click "Add Business Roles" to add relevant roles to this user

### Create role from template for business configurations

To handle business configuration entries, we have apps provided under the "Business Configuration" group on the Fiori Launchpad. To gain access to this group, a user needs to have the "BPC\_EXPERT" role assigned.

1. As administrator in the Fiori Launchpad for the consumer, open the "Maintain Business Roles" app
2. 
3. Click the "Create from Template" button and use the value help for template selection to choose "SAP\_BR\_BPC\_EXPERT"

![Business Process Configuration Export](BPCExpert.png)

3. This creates a new role with the required catalogs already assigned. Add the relevant business users to whom this role shall be assigned under the "Assigned Business Users" tab

![Users for BPC Expert](UsersForBPCExpert.png)

4. Maintain relevant restrictions for read/write using the "Maintain Restrictions" button

5. Save the role

### Maintain Business Configurations

The users with assigned  SAP\_BR\_BPC\_EXPERT role should now be able to see the applications under the "Business Configuration" group of the Fiori Launchpad,
